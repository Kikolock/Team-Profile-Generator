## Team Generator

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I needed to create a application that the use can choose a city around the world and check how is the temperature for today and next 5 days at that place.
During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page. Using constructors during this project makes everything works perfectly fine.

## Challenges for future improvement

Implement more functions when calling node index.js and new styles for the page.

## Installation and how to use

- First of all open terminal and install json packages using: "npm init -y", "npm i --save-dev jest", "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" 
- After that call the index.js using terminal by: node index.js
- Insert the information needed and follow the flow
- Done, now you have your Team cards created

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a team generator app that helps creating the team information using node through terminal:

- When the application starts the user needs to enter the Team manager information as name, Employee ID, email address and office number
- After that user can choose to select and create the engineer information as name, ID, email and github username
- Back to the menu, user can create another engineer or intern
- Selection intern option, user need to fill information as name, ID, email and school
- Back to the menu, user can finish building the team and then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team rester based on user input.
